# Fibonacci-Sequence

Fibonacci Sequence is a very popular sequence in which each is generated by sum of the last two terms, except for the first term, ie. '0' and the second term, ie. '1'.

The sequence is as follows: 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55  89  144  233  377  610  987  1597  2584  4181  6765  10946  17711  28657  46368  75025  121393  196418  317811  514229  832040  1346269  2178309....

Note: In C programming language, when we assign 'int' datatype to a variable, it automatically assigns 32 bits of memory to the variable, so its value can range from (-2147483647 to 2147483647). We also know that the Fibonacci Sequence can go till infinity, so at certain point the numbers may become so large that the memory allocated by 'int' datatype may not be enough then it may start to show garbage values (you can identify garbage values because they may appear to be negative), so to avoid this type of error, we assign a datatype which allocates more memory to the variable like 'long int' or 'long long int'.4

But it does not matter in Python language as it does not use a compiler but an interpreter for executing a program.
